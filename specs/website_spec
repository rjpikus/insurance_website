Yes, let‚Äôs define a **project spec for the user-facing website** that generates the clickstream data and interacts with the backend system described above.

This site acts as the **front-end experience for customers**, such as an e-commerce site or subscription service, and sends behavioral data (clicks, scrolls, logins, cart actions) to the backend analytics platform in real-time.

## üß† Project Spec: **User Website (Front-End Client)**

### üéØ **Goal**

Provide a responsive and engaging customer interface that:

* Delivers personalized experiences using backend ML predictions
* Sends user behavior events (clicks, page views, purchases) to the ingestion service
* Displays real-time offers or fraud warnings based on model inference

## üì¶ **Key Features**

### 1. **User Authentication**

* Secure login and account creation (JWT or OAuth)
* Tracks active user sessions for behavior analytics

### 2. **Behavioral Tracking**

* Clicks, page views, scroll depth, form submissions
* Events sent via `POST /track-event` to ingestion microservice

### 3. **Real-Time Personalization**

* On page load, call `/predict?user_id=123` to get:

  * Recommended products
  * Fraud score (if relevant)
  * Dynamic pricing tier

### 4. **Live Feedback**

* WebSockets connection shows fraud alerts or delivery status updates instantly

### 5. **Event Batching**

* Events are queued in browser memory
* Batch-sent every few seconds or before `unload` for efficiency

## ‚ú® **UI Components**

| Component          | Description                                                          |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ProductCarousel`  | Shows ML-personalized product suggestions                            |
| `FraudAlertBanner` | Displays risk warning if fraud score is high                         |
| `ActivityTracker`  | JS utility that listens to DOM events and queues events for dispatch |
| `SessionTimer`     | Logs session length, time on page, idle time                         |
| `CheckoutPage`     | Triggers transaction event + model prediction check                  |

## üîÑ **Event Payload Example**

```json
{
  "user_id": "abc123",
  "event_type": "add_to_cart",
  "timestamp": "2025-05-01T12:34:56Z",
  "page": "/product/234",
  "metadata": {
    "product_id": 234,
    "price": 29.99
  }
}
```

Sent to: `POST https://api.company.com/track-event`

## ‚úÖ **User Experience Workflow**

1. User visits homepage ‚Üí behavior tracking begins
2. API call to `/predict` returns recommended products ‚Üí displayed in `ProductCarousel`
3. User clicks products, scrolls, and adds items to cart ‚Üí events sent to backend
4. Fraud detection model returns a high-risk score ‚Üí `FraudAlertBanner` appears
5. All session data stored for analytics in S3 + Snowflake
