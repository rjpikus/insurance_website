Step-by-Step Blueprint (Free/Low-Cost)
🔹 1. Frontend (User Website)
Tech: Next.js or React + Tailwind CSS

Event tracking: Use localStorage + fetch() to POST to your local API

Deploy: Vercel Free Tier (No credit card needed)

👉 Free & public — showcase this live with a real URL.

🔹 2. Ingestion Microservice
Tech: Python + Flask + Docker

Function: Accepts events, logs them to local file or SQLite

Deploy (Optional): Use Railway or Render free tier

Alt: Run locally via Docker

👉 Simulates AWS Lambda / API Gateway + S3

🔹 3. Streaming/Data Processing
Tech: Simulate with queue.Queue or multiprocessing in Python

Alt Tools: Use Dask or Ray locally to simulate distributed compute

Prefect: Free to use locally or via Prefect Cloud Free Tier

👉 Mimics Spark/Ray cluster logic on your dev machine.

🔹 4. Feature Store (Emulated)
Build your own mini-feature store:

Store features in SQLite or in-memory dictionary

Have versioning, freshness TTLs, and entity lookups

👉 Fake Tecton functionality, but structure it the same.

🔹 5. ML Model + Inference API
Tech: scikit-learn or XGBoost + Flask/Ray Serve

Deploy: Run locally or containerize with Docker

Input: Receives features from the store and returns prediction

👉 Showcase real-time inference logic with fake or basic models.

🔹 6. Data Lake & Analytics
Instead of Snowflake: Use DuckDB locally

SQL queries over your event logs or Parquet files

Free and blazing fast

👉 DuckDB simulates analytics over event data — perfect for a portfolio project.

🔹 7. CI/CD Simulation
Tools: GitHub Actions (free)

What to automate:

Linting and tests on push

Docker image builds

Prefect flow validation

👉 Looks professional — and shows DevOps skills.

🔹 8. Hosting (Optional but Polished)
Frontend: Vercel (free, live URL)

Backend (1 microservice): Render/Glitch/Replit free tier

Or: Run everything locally and record a video walkthrough

💼 How to Present It on Your Resume
Project Name: Real-Time Behavioral Analytics Platform
Tech Stack: Python, Flask, Ray, DuckDB, Prefect, React, Docker, GitHub Actions
Description:

Built an end-to-end system that collects user behavior data, processes it with a simulated feature store and ML inference API, and visualizes insights via SQL-based analytics. Designed to mimic enterprise-scale architecture using free and local tooling.

🎁 Bonus Tip
Record a short demo video:

Walk through the website

Show events flowing into your Flask API

Run a Prefect flow

Call your ML API

Show analytics with DuckDB

Upload to YouTube or Loom, link it on your resume or GitHub. It makes your project stand out 10x more than just code alone.
