## ðŸ“¦ **Cost Breakdown (at 1000 users/day)**

| Category                          | Monthly Cost | Notes                                                    |
| --------------------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Frontend Hosting (Vercel)**     | \$0â€“50       | Free for small sites, upgrades needed at scale           |
| **AWS EC2 (Microservices)**       | \$150â€“300    | t3.medium x 2â€“3 instances (ingestor, model, feature API) |

## ðŸ’¡ Key Cost Factors by Scale

| Cost Type               | Scales With...            | Notes                               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| EC2, compute            | API & model usage         | Higher with more users/inference    |
| S3, storage             | Data volume               | Scales linearly with logs/events    |
| Snowflake               | Query complexity & volume | Dashboards, joins, ML exports       |
| Tecton                  | Feature count & updates   | Real-time feature serving is \$\$\$ |
| CI/CD (Jenkins, DevOps) | Developer activity        | Minimal unless large teams          |

## ðŸš¨ At 10,000 Users/Day

You likely need:

* **Dedicated EC2 autoscaling group or EKS**
* **Caching layers (Redis)**
* **Real-time event bus (Kafka or Kinesis)**
* **Dedicated Snowflake warehouse**
* **Support tiers for all vendors**

At this point, **costs can easily hit \$20kâ€“30k/month** depending on usage patterns and ML needs.
